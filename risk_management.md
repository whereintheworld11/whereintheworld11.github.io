Evan develops solutions while considering the various potential pitfalls, ensuring the highest likelihood of success. He also led cross-team innovation and product team focused on emerging risks for a financial institution's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Models Development group:
* **Transaction monitoring model build.** Evan's team assessed the money laundering risk of the acquired wealth management firm's products, concluding a transaction-monitoring model was necessary to mitigate the risk. He then partnered with an analyst to lead the end-to-end development of the model, including design, development, data controls, testing, and launch. The model, the first new model developed in at least 3 years, was intended to allow the acquired firm to pursue its 7X growth ambitions.

Evan and his team defined the risk and determined the magnitude was nearly $200M in transaction value, Evan partnered with leaders across multiple organizations and presented a mitigation recommendation to senior-executive AML and Fraud leadership. The implemented solution requiring minimal investment and satisfied the scrutiny of federal regulators.
