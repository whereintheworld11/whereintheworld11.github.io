### Analytics and data science

Leading companies use their data to make better decisions than their competitors. They use it to drive customer acquisition, sales, and retention. [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/five-facts-how-customer-analytics-boosts-corporate-performance) found that analytics champions increase their likelihood of above-average profitability by almost 19 times. Yet, according to [Forrester Research](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/hadoop-is-datas-darling-for-a-reason/), ‚Äúbetween 60% and 73% of all data within an enterprise goes unused for analytics.‚Äù

Project example:
* Determined root causes leading to the sign-in failure of target customers. Identified and implemented a ‚Äúgood‚Äù solution to mitigate the issue leading to 600K logins worth at least $1.2M, while the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù solution was mired in prioritization hurdles.

### Risk management

Sometimes people seek gain at others' expense, and occasionally business or data processes break down. Mitigating losses requires controls to prevent risk and rapid identification and response when things go wrong.
