Business growth requires determining where to play, who to serve, and how to win (or [product-market fit](https://medium.com/@jnvipul/pm-corner-what-is-product-market-fit-pmf-9c087b7edadd)). These can change based on external market factors and as a business matures. Ideas become viable solutions through the stages of discovery, definition, development, and delivery.

### Analytics and data science

Leading companies use their data to make better decisions than their competitors. They use it to drive customer acquisition, sales, and retention. McKinsey & Company found that analytics champions increase their likelihood of above-average profitability by almost 19 times. Yet, according to Forrester Research, “between 60% and 73% of all data within an enterprise goes unused for analytics.”

People seek gain at others expense and business / data processes sometimes break down. Mitigating losses requires controls to prevent risk and rapid identification and response when things go wrong.
