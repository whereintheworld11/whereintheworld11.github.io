üì¶ Select projects I‚Äôve delivered:

‚Ä¢ Designed and implemented an operating model to fully leverage the contributions of cross-functional team members, complete with governance structures and a decision framework.

‚Ä¢ Launched a cross-marketing email project that achieved a $71M run rate, including building the business case, project management, writing the creative brief, developing and implementing the launch plan (in-market testing and scaling), and building monitoring (funnel and booking metrics).

‚Ä¢ Determined root causes leading to the sign-in failure of target customers. Identified and implemented a ‚Äúgood‚Äù solution to mitigate the issue leading to 600K logins worth at least $1.2M, while the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù solution was mired in prioritization hurdles.

## Practice Areas

### Business management / strategy 

Business growth requires determining where to play, who to serve, and how to win (or [product-market fit](https://medium.com/@jnvipul/pm-corner-what-is-product-market-fit-pmf-9c087b7edadd)). These can change based on external market factors and as a business matures. Ideas become viable solutions through the stages of discovery, definition, development, and delivery.

### Analytics and data science

Leading companies use their data to make better decisions than their competitors. They use it to drive customer acquisition, sales, and retention. [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/five-facts-how-customer-analytics-boosts-corporate-performance) found that analytics champions increase their likelihood of above-average profitability by almost 19 times. Yet, according to [Forrester Research](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/hadoop-is-datas-darling-for-a-reason/), ‚Äúbetween 60% and 73% of all data within an enterprise goes unused for analytics.‚Äù

### Risk management

Sometimes people seek gain at others' expense, and occasionally business or data processes break down. Mitigating losses requires controls to prevent risk and rapid identification and response when things go wrong.
