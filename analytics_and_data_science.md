## Analytics and data science

Leading companies use their data to make better decisions than their competitors. They use it to drive customer acquisition, sales, and retention. [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/five-facts-how-customer-analytics-boosts-corporate-performance) found that analytics champions increase their likelihood of above-average profitability by almost 19 times. Yet, according to [Forrester Research](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/hadoop-is-datas-darling-for-a-reason/), “between 60% and 73% of all data within an enterprise goes unused for analytics.”

Evan marries successful business management and strategy principles with analytics to find and achieve value for companies and their customers. Recent project examples:
* More than 70% of target customers were failing to sign into a web portal, yet the perfect solution was mired in an enterprise backlog and unlikely to be implemented for months. Evan found that most of these customers were landing at the web portal from email links. With minimal engineering investment, the links were updated to re-route these customers to the mobile app sign-in page. The change had the potential to drive 600K logins worth at least $1.2M.
* Changing the order of offers on the marketplace page was expected to impact consumer conversion. Instead, an A/B test revealed that which offer was listed first did not produce a statistically significant difference in conversion. Rather than building an automated solution to optimize order sequencing, the team focused resources elsewhere.
* US pandemic relief funds drove a massive spike in ATM transactions as well as alert volumes for the anti-money laundering data monitoring model increasing investigation backlogs and leading to substantial costs and regulatory risk. Another team unsuccessfully attempted to find a solution before Evan's team was asked to help. A cohort analysis, other data analysis and investigator interviews corrected the team's understanding and revealed an opportunity to immediately cut 16K alerts, saving $3.5M. Additional hypothesis testing and 10K simulations revealed an opportunity to cut an additional 15K alerts, saving another $3M.
