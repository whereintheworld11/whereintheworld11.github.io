## Engagement model

My process typically includes:

* <em> Understand.</em> I will listen and learn about your organization, what’s working and what you’re trying to achieve. Enduring success requires understanding your organization enough to create a solution that can be sustained by your team.

* <em> Proposal.</em> I will develop a perspective on what is achievable and share how I plan to do it. Together, we can tweak the plan to ensure the output meets the needs. We can also adjust the working model depending upon your desired involvement level. I’ll estimate costs and time required and if you are happy, we will proceed.

* <em> Build.</em> I will develop the solution. For longer projects, it is critical that we meet regularly for me to share progress and to discuss any modifications to ensure the solution meets your needs.

* <em> Presentation / demo.</em> I will share the solution, any relevant documentation, and answer any questions to ensure it will fully serve your needs.

* <em> Ongoing support.</em> If you have questions, I’m here! Just drop me a line or we can set up a quick call. Your business and needs will change over time, so we can always build upon or update the solution!

We can adjust the working model to your specific needs. [Email Evan](mailto:grow.with.a.purpose@gmail.com) to start the conversation.
